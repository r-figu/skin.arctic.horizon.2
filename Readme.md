The skin has been (minimally) tweaked to cover my needs: Kodi Matrix running on a Nvidia Shield (2017) and using Emby Server as media server. I have zero expertise with kodi skinning and not much time to look into it, so there's probably a much better way to do all the tweaked stuff.

Many thanks to jurialmunkey for his brilliant and awesome work! I've been running the Arctic skins for years.
