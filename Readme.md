The skin has been (minimally) tweaked to cover my needs. Main differences:

- ~Hide top menu search icon/bar~ _Option available on upstream, yay!_
- Incorporate [languageflags](https://github.com/r-figu/skin.arctic.horizon.2/tree/main/media/languageflags) into the skin and clean/add missing flags (ISO 639-2/T 3 letter code)
- Change fullscreen widget controls position 
- Hide fullscreen/row plotbox
- Hide ratings and aired info
- Hide studio logo on no-tvshow content
- Studio logos are now locally stored
- Show original title 

Config:

- Home elements: Fullscreen widget or multi-widgets with no info whatsoever
- Views: Row + vertical wall mode

Many thanks to jurialmunkey for his brilliant and awesome work! I've been running the Arctic skins for years.
