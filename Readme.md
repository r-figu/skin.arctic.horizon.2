The skin has been (minimally) tweaked to cover my needs. Main differences:

- ~Hide top menu search icon/bar~ _Option available on upstream, yay!_
- Incorporate [languageflags](https://github.com/r-figu/skin.arctic.horizon.2/tree/main/media/languageflags) into the skin and clean/add missing flags (ISO 639-2/T 3 letter code)
- Incorporate [studios.white](https://github.com/XBMC-Addons/resource.images.studios.white) into the skin and change/add some logos
- Change fullscreen widget controls position 
- Hide fullscreen/row plotbox
- Hide ratings and aired info

So for the Home screen basically I'm using the Fullscreen widget alone or combined widgets with no info whatsoever, and row + wall as inner views.

Many thanks to jurialmunkey for his brilliant and awesome work! I've been running the Arctic skins for years.
